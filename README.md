# Forth Exploration

Forth, created by Charles H. Moore in the 1970s, was one of the first languages
to put an explicit, user-visible data stack at the center of an interactive
programming system.<br>
It later showed up in real products like Open Firmware on some Macs and Unix
workstations, and has also been used in a few specialized NASA and aerospace
projects. 

```bash
forth hello.fs
```
